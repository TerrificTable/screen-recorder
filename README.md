# screen-recorder
A screen recorder (like OBS just without a GUI), idk why you would you use it? but could be nice to learn stuff
Anyways its made using the librarys:
  - cv2 (OpenCV) - pip install opencv-python
  - pyautogui - pip install pyautogui
  - keyboard - pip install keyboard
  - numpy - preinstalled with python

If you want to change stuff in the recorder open the file using some kind of text editing program or IDE
It should be preaty good comented and easy to change stuff if you want to
