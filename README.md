# screen-recorder
A screen recorder (like OBS just without a GUI), idk why you would you use it? but could be nice to learn stuff
Anyways its made using the librarys:
  - cv2 (OpenCV) - pip install opencv-python
  - pyautogui - pip install pyautogui
  - keyboard - pip install keyboard
  - numpy - preinstalled with python
